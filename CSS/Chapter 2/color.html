    CSS Colors: Colors in CSS can be specified by the following methods:

        Predefined color names,
        Hexadecimal colors,
        RGB colors,
        RGBA colors,
        HSL colors,
        HSLA colors

        <br><br>

        1. Predefined color names: For example: blue, red, coral, brown, etc
            <h1>Predefined</h1>

        2. Hexadecimal color: A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, 
                              where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers 
                              specify the components of the color. All values must be between 00 and FF.
            <h2>Hexadecimal</h2>

        3. RGB colors: An RGB color value is specified with the rgb() function, which has the following syntax:
                       rgb(red, green, blue)
                       Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color and can be an
                       integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage value (from 0% to 100%).
            <h3>RGB</h3>

        4. RGBA colors: RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel 
                        which specifies the opacity of the object.
                        rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
                        The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
            <h4>RGBA</h4>

        5. HSL color: HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness - and represents a cylindrical-coordinate 
                      representation of colors.An HSL color value is specified with the hsl() function, 
                      which has the following syntax:
                      hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
                      Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360) 
                      - 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
                      Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color. 
                      Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is black, 100% is white.
            <p>HSL</p>

        6. HSLA color: HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel
                       which specifies the opacity of the object.
